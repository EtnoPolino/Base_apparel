## Overview

I consider this a fail. i just cant get the responsive correctly. it's not what i wanted to achieve with responsive side.
The input bar are way too big in differents mobile screen. exemple : Screen Ipad Air, Screen Ipad Mini, or Screen Surface Pro 7.
Screen Nest Hub is also a problem no lining correctly.
Litteraly everything...

I went from mobile frist design to desktop first design (never again..)

For this one, i went with the display GRID route instead of the FLEXBOX route, i wanted to try GRID for the first time.

Another issue i have is when you enter several failed or good email, they will get resgister (as computer cookies i guess), then you click on your in input bar, it'll propose you the previous emails you enter, the problem is that when you chose on these previows, they is a colored padding around that email. I cant get rid of it.
